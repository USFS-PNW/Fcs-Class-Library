This project has third-party references.

There are 3 Devart references: Devart.Data.dll, Devart.Data.Oracle.dll, and Devart.Data.Oracle.Entity.dll.
Devart is licensed software so these .dll's cannot be stored in GitHub where they are publicly available.
After Devart dotConnect for Oracle v8.3 is installed, configure the .dll references to point to the Devart
installation directory. In Windows 7 this directory is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Devart"

EntityFramework v5.0 is a Microsoft library and can be installed using the NuGet Package Manager. From
